# Bellybutton-Biodiversity

## Summary
I created a webpage to display information on bacteria in belly buttons. 
An experiment was conducted to have anonomyous donors submit bacteria in order to see what kinds of bacteria was best for usages in plantbased food. 
Based on that person's ID, you can find demographic information such as ethnicity, gender, age,location, BBTYPE and WFREQ. 

## Visual representations
Once an ID is selected,


  The guage determines the frequency of washing the belly button area for each volunteer.
  The bar graph represents the top 10 bacteria found in the nasal for that specific person.
  The Bubble Graph is used to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in that volunteer's navel.

Further thoughts:
It might be interesting to use demographic information to compare similarities/differences and see if there is a correlation or some
sort of 'ideal person' for particular bacteria that the lab is interested in.
